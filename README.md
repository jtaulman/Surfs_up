### December

- Contains less data points, but still enough to be considered accurate
- As expected is overall cooler than June, but there is not a big difference
- There is a high standard deviation due to December having greater temperature fluxuation

## Summary

Between June and December the best month to visit would be June because the temperature would be more consistant. The max and average for each month are not far off but the min has an 8 degree difference, which is why the month of June would be best to travel. I would like to perform two additional queries on the data to compare June and December. First, I would pull the weather data to see how often it is sunny, rainy, windy, etc. because that impacts a persons vacation. Second, I would pull the humidity data because 76 degrees with high humidty is very different than 76 with low humidty. When somone is looking for a time to visit Hawaii knowing the temperature, type of weather, and humidity would be enough data to determine between the months of June and December.
